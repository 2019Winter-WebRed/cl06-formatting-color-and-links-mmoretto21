        <h3>Matchbox 20 is an american rock band from Orlando Fl.</h3><p>They first started in 1995, and are still together despite branching off for single projects. Some of their top hits that still are being played on the radio are from their first album. Their first album 'Yourself or Someone Like You' produced 'Real World', and '3Am'. 3Am is one of my favorites. 'Bright Lights' and 'Lonely No More' are also great hits. Rob Thomas is the lead vocalist and has produced albums and songs by himself and with other artists. I personally have seen him twice, with my mom who is a big fan and who has played their music since before I was born.</p>
